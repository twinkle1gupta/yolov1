# YOLOv1 from Scratch

This repository implements the YOLOv1 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm from scratch. It includes a tool for generating anchor boxes using k-means clustering on bounding box data, which is an essential step for the YOLO algorithm.

## Features

* **Anchor Box Generation**: Uses k-means clustering to generate optimal anchor boxes from a set of bounding box dimensions.
* **Interactive Interface**: Built using Streamlit, allowing users to upload their data and visualize the results in real-time.
* **Data Visualization**: Plots the generated anchor boxes and calculates the Average Intersection over Union (IoU).

## How It Works

1. **Anchor Box Generation**: The algorithm uses k-means clustering to generate anchor boxes based on the width and height of input bounding boxes.
2. **CSV File Input**: Users upload a CSV file with bounding box dimensions (width, height) for training.
3. **Visualization**: The results, including the generated anchor boxes and Average IoU, are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yolov1-from-scratch.git
   cd yolov1-from-scratch
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamline.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upload a CSV file containing bounding box data (columns: `width`, `height`).
2. Select the number of anchor boxes you want to generate.
3. Click "Generate Anchor Boxes" to process the data.
4. View the results:

   * **Anchor Boxes**: List of generated anchor boxes.
   * **Average IoU**: The average Intersection over Union score of the generated anchor boxes.
   * **Plot**: A visual representation of bounding boxes and anchor boxes.

## Example CSV Format

The CSV file should contain at least the following columns:

* `xmin`: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
* `ymin`: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner.
* `xmax`: The x-coordinate of the bottom-right corner.
* `ymax`: The y-coordinate of the bottom-right corner.

**Note**: The script will automatically calculate the `width` and `height` from the `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, and `ymax` columns.

## Requirements

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* streamlit
* pillow
